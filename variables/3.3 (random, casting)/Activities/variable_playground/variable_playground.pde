// Declare your global variables here
// You'll need multiple variable types (float and int at minimum)

void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
  // Initialize your variables here
  // Some should be based on width/height
  // Some should be hardcoded numbers
  
}

void draw() {
  background(0);
  // Use your variables here to create something that moves/changes
  // Remember to update variable values to create change
  
}

void mousePressed() {
  // Do something when the mouse is clicked!
  
}

/* PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------
Variable Types & Declaration
- Use at least 3 variable types (float, int, color)
- Declare multiple variables in one line using commas

Variable Initialization
- Initialize a variable using width/height
- Initialize a variable using mathematical expressions
- Initialize a variable using random()
- Use casting between float and int when appropriate (and at least once)

Variable Usage
- Create motion by changing variable values over time
- Use variables in multiple places
- Use variables for colors
- Use variables as parameters in multiple shapes/functions

Variable Scope
- Use both global and local variables appropriately
- Demonstrate understanding of when to use each

GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Your sketch should create some kind of animated visual
- It can be abstract or representational
- Think about how variables can create interesting change over time
- Focus on making creative use of variables rather than complex drawings

CREATIVE PROMPTS (if needed):
- A landscape where elements change size/position/color
- An abstract pattern generator
- A character that moves or changes
- A weather simulation
- A simple particle system
- A color-changing design
